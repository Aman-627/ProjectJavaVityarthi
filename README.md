# Educational Course & Enrollment Management System

## 📌 Overview
This is a Java-based **Educational Course & Enrollment Management System**.  
It allows students, instructors, and admins to manage courses, enrollments, and grades through a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**.  

The project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts like Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Builder Pattern.

2004: Java 5 - A major update that brought Generics, Enums, and Annotations.

2014: Java 8 - A landmark release introducing Lambda expressions, the Streams API, and a new Date/Time API.

2017: Java 9 - Introduced the Java Platform Module System (JPMS).

2021: Java 17 (LTS) - The current Long-Term Support version, which added Records and Sealed Classes.

Java Editions: SE, EE, and ME
Java SE (Standard Edition): The core Java platform. It provides all the essential libraries and APIs for building general-purpose desktop and console applications. This project is built using Java SE.

Java EE (Enterprise Edition): Now known as Jakarta EE, this edition extends Java SE with APIs for building large-scale, distributed enterprise applications, such as web services and complex business systems.

Java ME (Micro Edition): A lightweight subset of Java designed for resource-constrained environments like mobile phones, sensors, and IoT devices.

JDK vs JRE vs JVM
JVM (Java Virtual Machine): An abstract machine that executes compiled Java bytecode. It is the component that allows Java to be platform-independent.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment): The software package that provides the JVM along with the standard Java class libraries needed to run Java applications.

JDK (Java Development Kit): The complete software development kit for Java. It includes the JRE as well as development tools like the compiler (javac), debugger, and archiver (jar) needed to create Java applications.
